## React Frontend for Housing Aggregator

*Code Documentation still in progress*

This repo contains the frontend for my housing aggregator. It uses React+typescript. It interfaces with the [listings API](https://github.com/sidHathi/listingsApi) to allow searching and filtering over housing listings found by the [listing Scraper](https://github.com/sidHathi/listingScraper).

## Usage

**To run locally**: `npm install`, `npm start`.

**Live deployment underway**
